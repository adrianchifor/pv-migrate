# pv-migrate

This is a cli tool/kubectl plugin to easily migrate
the contents of one Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` to another.

Common use case: You have a database with a bound 50gb PersistentVolumeClaim.
Unfortunately 50gb was not enough and you filled all the disk space rather quickly.
And sadly your StorageClass/provisioner doesn't support [volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/).
Now you need to create a new PVC of 1tb and somehow copy all the data to the new volume, as-is, with its permissions and so on.

Another use case: You need to move a PersistentVolumeClaim from one namespace to another.

## Usage

To migrate contents of PersistentVolumeClaim small-pvc in namespace ns-a
to the PersistentVolumeClaim big-pvc in namespace ns-b, use the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl pv-migrate \
  --source-namespace ns-a \
  --source small-pvc \
  --dest-namespace ns-b \
  --dest big-pvc
```
This will create a temporary **sshd** pod that has the `small-pvc` mounted,
and an **rsync** job with `big-pvc` mounted, and will rsync the whole content from the source to the target.
It will clean up the temporary resources it created after the operation is completed (or failed).

The output will be like the following:
```
INFO[0000] Both claims exist and bound, proceeding...

```


**Note:** For it to run as kubectl plugin via `kubectl pv-migrate`,
put the binary with name `kubectl-pv_migrate` under your `PATH`.
To use it standalone, simply run it like `./pv-migrate --source-namespace ....`

## Building

To build for your platform
```bash
$ go mod download
$ go build
```

To build for all major platforms and prepare release archives:
```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

## Notes

* This version has a **hardcoded RSA public/private
key pair** in the sshd/rsync docker images and in the codebase.
This is intentional, since security is not a concern at this release.
In the future, a key pair will probably be generated on the client and be used instead.
